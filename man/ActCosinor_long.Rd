\title{Cosinor Model for Circadian Rhythmicity for the Whole Dataset}
\usage{
ActCosinor_long(count.data, window = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{count.data}{\code{data.frame} of dimension n * (p+2) containing the
p dimensional activity data for all n subject days.
The first two columns have to be ID and Day. ID can be
either \code{character} or \code{numeric}. Day has to be \code{numeric} indicating
the sequence of days within each subject.}

\item{window}{The calculation needs the window size of the data. E.g window = 1 means each epoch is in one-minute window.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following 5 columns
\item{ID}{ID}
\item{ndays}{number of days}
\item{mes}{MESRO, which is short for midline statistics of rhythm, which is a rhythm adjusted mean. This represents mean activity level.}
\item{amp}{amplitude, a measure of half the extend of predictable variation within a cycle. This represents the highest activity one can achieve.}
\item{acro}{acrophase, a meaure of the time of the overall high values recurring in each cycle. Here it has a unit of radian. This represents time to reach the peak.}
\item{acrotime}{acrophase in the unit of the time (hours)}
\item{ndays}{Number of days modeled}
}
\description{
A parametric approach to study circadian rhythmicity assuming cosinor shape.This function is a whole dataset
wrapper for \code{ActCosinor}.
