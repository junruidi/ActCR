\title{Cosinor Model for Circadian Rhythmicity}
\usage{
ActCosinor(x, window = 1, export_ts = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{vector} vector of dimension n*1440 which reprsents n days of 1440 minute activity data}

\item{window}{The calculation needs the window size of the data. E.g window = 1 means each epoch is in one-minute window.}

\item{export_ts}{A Boolean to indicate whether time series should be exported}
}
\value{
A list with elements
\item{mes}{MESOR which is short for midline statistics of rhythm, which is a rhythm adjusted mean. This represents mean activity level.}
\item{amp}{amplitude, a measure of half the extend of predictable variation within a cycle. This represents the highest activity one can achieve.}
\item{acro}{acrophase, a meaure of the time of the overall high values recurring in each cycle. Here it has a unit of radian. This represents time to reach the peak.}
\item{acrotime}{acrophase in the unit of the time (hours)}
\item{ndays}{Number of days modeled}
\item{cosinor_ts}{Exported data frame with time, time over days, original time series, fitted time series using cosinor model}
}
\description{
A parametric approach to study circadian rhythmicity assuming cosinor shape.
}
\examples{
count1 = c(t(example_activity_data$count[c(1:2),-c(1,2)]))
cos_coeff = ActCosinor(x = count1, window = 1, export_ts = TRUE)
